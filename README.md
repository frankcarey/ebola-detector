HOW DOES IT WORK?
===========
Uses a remote temperature sensor to detect fever from afar. It currently uses an arduino and a temp sensor over i2c (TODO PART#)

WHY DID YOU MAKE IT?
============
This was a hackathon project. I was interested in learning about i2c communication and getting data from this sensor.

It worked pretty well considering there is a small difference in temperature between normal body temps and fever.

TODO
======
Write up more details like wiring of the sensor.
